>  As a result of the above, I reworked my biblio fields for my book type.
> I noticed that some of the tags are not "draggable" to the layout column, 
even though they are listed in the field/tag column.
> For example, 260g (Date of Manufacture) 
(I was looking at this option as a reprint date, when I was investigating the above)
> This is not a problem for me at the moment 
(all fields required have been dragged to the layout column)
