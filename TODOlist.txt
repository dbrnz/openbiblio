>  As a result of the above, I reworked my biblio fields for my book type.
> I noticed that some of the tags are not "draggable" to the layout column, 
even though they are listed in the field/tag column.
> For example, 260g (Date of Manufacture) 
(I was looking at this option as a reprint date, when I was investigating the above)
> This is not a problem for me at the moment 
(all fields required have been dragged to the layout column)

20April2013 - Neil Redgate
>  One more observation to add to the to do list -
> If I access a book item and select edit item, I get the full display of 
all the MARC fields that I have selected in the Biblio Fields Layout box 
(see image: Edit Existing Item - book)
> However, if I select a non-book item (this example being a map), 
I get the full display for the book media type (see image: Edit Existing Item - non-book)
> If I attempt to change the media type using the drop down menu, 
there is no change in the fields displayed (unlike Add New Item, see below)
>
> When the Add New Item box is on the page, when the media type is selected 
using the drop down menu, the range of fields displayed change to reflect the 
selection for the chosen media type (arranged in the Biblio Fields Layout box), 
see attached images : Add New Item - book/non-book.
> It looks like the Edit properties box is not responding to the media type 
selected nor to the drop down menu.
