In the process of another test I deleted all the entries in my system
(using the web-interface). Just checking the tables, which should all be empty,
I found that the Custom Fields are still there.
So the remove function should include custom fields, which is currently probably not the case.

investigate making school grade, teacher, optional.  If not used then 'Audience Level'
should not appear on advanced search screen.
note 26 May 2013:
teacher & grade are custom copy fields. Audience level should be removed.

Edit Biblio does not allow entering more than one subject line at a time.  Look into
using more of code from 'new item' server process.

15 July 2013 - Nel/Fred
There is no good design reason for not allowing editing copy or item data while
a book is on loan or any other status for that matter.  Book/copy data is just
that and doesn't change because the item is unavailable.  Now it could be that
the code has a hole in it and this was a simple temporary fix.
But it should not be left in place.

If I update the edit page of a currently: checked in item (ie: with drop-down menu blank) -
the status of the copy (in the summary table) is now changed to NULL and the
availability icon (in search results) changes from green (available) to Red (on loan).
Epiphany, Chromium, Firefox)
If I open the edit page for a copy with NULL status, the text "current: checked-in"
is displayed to the right of the blank drop-down menu.

Member accounts.
The add / delete functions work perfectly.
One minor issue - the data entered into the 'description' and 'amount' fields
(when adding new transaction) are not removed when the transaction is displayed below.
In fact if I go straight to any other member's account, this data is visible in the
two fields until I leave the circulation "environment" - identical to the problem of
deleting a single transaction
The added transaction remains displayed with the correct member (as it should).

24 July 2013 - Neil, fixed 25 July
Item search report: first page listed correctly but the links to subsequent pages
do not work - just shows the results page headers and no items.

24 July 2013 - Neil, fixed 25 July
>  When I view the edit page for any copy currently out on loan, the status drop down
menu is blank - is this normal/expected behaviour? The summary page clearly shows the
copy out on loan and to which member
> Typically, an non-checked out copy has 'checked in' showing in the status drop-down menu
> If an item is loaned out, should this status box show 'on loan' ?
Certainly 'in, out, hold' should not be allowed as choices or all control goes bad.
The other book maintenance related values make sense as there is no other way to take book
off the shelve to patrons.

Checking-in:

> Delete transaction: message 'deleted' appears but transaction remains on screen.
Have to leave the circulation "environment" (eg select cataloging | existing items)
and then return to the accounts page to see that the deleted transaction is no longer displayed.

Check in does not fully work -
I can enter a barcode and select "add to shelving cart" button

In the copy summary table the correct details are shown for each separate barcode.
However, if I select to edit the copy with the lowest or a lower barcode,
the edit page lists the details for the most recent copy added (ie highest barcode).

I have only noticed this problem now and so I am not aware of when it first appeared
(this problem is still present with changeset 810) - see attached image of library settings -
the field entries are placed before the field title
This occurs with with Tools | system settings (see image) but not with Admin |
online options (see image)

15 Jul 2013 - Neil, line break insertion now allowed - 15 July
In phpMyAdmin, I have added (0 = auto arrange) to the new photo column field title
but cannot get it to sit below the field title (see image library settings) -
thought it would be useful to give the user this option?
I have relabelled some of my fields - see attached images.
UPDATE `openbibliowork`.`settings` SET `title` = 'Photo Columns<br>(0 for auto)' WHERE `settings`.`name` = 'item_columns';

19 May 2013 - Fred, proposal withdrawn by Fred 13 July
on-line papers, articles, blogs, etc. Sites go away, or change URL.
why can't I store that entire document right in OB, along with all the usual
biblio information. Then when I search for a topic, that paper will spring up
just like any other, and the call number will imediately me its in local storage,
and perhaps via circ/checkout allow me to retrieve a copy.

Or make display adapt to current width and set nmbr of rows accordingly.

9 July 2013 - Neil, done 13 July, Photo Columns Settings must be zero to work
The Research | Cover photo page appears to be restricted to 7 images in a row.
I presume this is to keep it usable for the smaller screen of any mobile device?
Is it possible to allow the number of images in a row to expand automatically for a pc monitor?
Sometime ago, I recall you mentioning something similar to this about pages (search results?)
automatically adjusting themselves according to  screen (browser window) size

20 Jun 2013 - Neil, fixed early July
CSV import:
The collection and media-type are not retained through the import process.
OBs default selection for these are provided for each item imported.
(I no longer have columns for these categories in my csv file)
I don't think they are actually registered with the item initially -
immediately after import, if I locate the new items in the existing items search window,
the icon for the media-type is missing.
The icon only becomes visible after I  have edited (and updated) the item.

The title & subtitle fields only allow 75 characters.
Can I change its size (from within OB or myPHP admin) or is this something that 
you have to amend within the programme to ensure full synchronicity?
Would this be a useful edit option to have for each filed listed in the 
biblio fields Maintenance page -so users can adjust their dbase according to their needs?
(Something in the back of my mind is saying that I may have asked about this very early on and,
I apologise, I cannot remember what your comment was - 
as to whether there is a physical limit from mysql/OB 
or it was something to be looked at a later date?)
