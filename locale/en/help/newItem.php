<h3>New Item Pages:</h3>
<p>
In order to enter a new item, the user must enter all the particulars of that item.
<br />
There are three methods available to add to the catalog:
	<ol>
	  <li>Manual Entry where the user types all the pertinant data into a form</li>
	  <li>Import of a single item's data from an on-line repository</li>
	  <li>Bulk import an existing file of data formated for MARC</li>
	</ol>
Only the first two will be described here.
