/**********************************************************************************
 *  Instructions for translators:
 *
 *  All gettext key/value pairs are specified as follows:
 *   $trans["key"] = "<php translation code to set the $text variable>";
 *  Allowing translators the ability to execute php code withint the transFunc string
 *  provides the maximum amount of flexibility to format the languange syntax.
 *
 *  Formatting rules:
 *  - Input arguments must be surrounded by % characters (i.e. %pageCount%).
 *  - A backslash ('\') needs to be placed before any special php characters
 *   (such as $, ", etc.) within the php translation code.
 *
 *  Simple Example:
 *   $trans["homeWelcome"]    = "Welcome to OpenBiblio";
 *
 *  Example Containing Argument Substitution:
 *   $trans["searchResult"]   = "page %page% of %pages%";
 *
 *  Example Containing a PHP If Statment and Argument Substitution:
 *   $trans["searchResult"]   =
 *    "if (%items% == 1) {
 *     \$text = '%items% result';
 *    } else {
 *     \$text = '%items% results';
 *    }";
